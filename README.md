# Aqua Maverick IIoT System üíß‚öôÔ∏è

## Overview
**Aqua Maverick** is an Industrial IoT (IIoT) solution for **Industrial Water Quality Monitoring, Management, and Predictive Maintenance**.  
It integrates:

- **PLC Control** for real-time process automation
- **Node-RED Dashboard** for visualization and control
- **Webpage** for project overview and quick access to the dashboard

The system continuously monitors critical water parameters like **pH**, **TDS**, **Temperature**, and **Turbidity**, enabling automated safety control and data-driven decision-making.
